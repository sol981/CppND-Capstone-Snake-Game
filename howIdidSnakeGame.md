1. read requirement then determine which feature should added in to project
2. brainstorm with code base & draw structure code
3. answer some question about this project 
4. how to add some feature into project, how to apply something into exist code

after that, I had 2 approach:
    1. each time I will only update little bit until reach all goal
    2. write all structure for project after apply all feature
    
however, I fail wit secondth approach, dont know what should to do, it might I don't know how to do it.
-> I decide to use 1st approach.

    1. Choose level at start
    2. Save high score
    3. There are 2 snakes, 1 controled by user, 1 controler by A* argorithm
    4. Multiple type of food
    5. Support various obstacle
    
featture search A* is hardest -> do it at final.
and about other feature, to complete it. i must understand the structure before -> after apply. 

know it -> understand it -> do it.

5. a process controller another snake is hardese
- think how 1 user, 1 process controler snake in real (not with code, just think how it look like)
- develop multiple controller for both snake and process
    + user enter input with keyboard
    + process use directly charater pass parameter into function _. control snake
- review old code A star: 1 use grid, 1 use map -> grid is fit, write interface first for A* agorithm.
- imagine how it work -> code flow -> implement code
- test it is so important (to test make sure every step can tested becafully)
- maybe do not know how it look like at start but continue do and think -> solution.

* if you have code base, make it work then improve it, other why you must make sure what you intend to to, draw structure, flow diagram, structure diagram.
* imagine real object at reality
* think how it work in real life is fist step before code.
